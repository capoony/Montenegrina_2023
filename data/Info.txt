I attach here the main data matrix in DAT format. All the taxa have been already marked by means of colour (representing the clade) and a symbol (representing a taxon).
The matrix contains both quantitative data (from the column SH to BC) and qualitative data (from columns atrium_type to proximal_vagina_type concerning genitalia and from columns neck-inflection to plica_basalis for the shell). 
For the quantitative data, all of them are in millimeters, except for W that stands for "number of whorls" and OA and LA that are measured in degrees. 
As discussed with Lisi, the NJ with the quantitative data seems to be OK, except for the rooting that should be adjusted. 
We'd like to obtain a tree also with the qualitative to see how taxa reciprocally spread and a sort of "concatenated" tree quantit+qualit.
Of course you're free to play around and see what this matrix could also provide.
Please find here the acronyms:
Genitalia: A atrium, AT atrium type, BC bursa copulatrix, D diverticulum, DV distal vagina, E epiphallus, ET epiphallus type, FO free oviduct, IDVT inner distal vagina type, P penis, PC penial complex, PPT penial papilla type, PR proximal vagina, PT penis type, V vagina.
Shell: AH aperture height, AW aperture width, BWH body whorl height, L lunella, LA lunella angle, LP lunella position, LSS lamella superior vs. spiralis, NI neck inflection (type), OA ornamentation (striae/ribs) angle, PB plica basalis (type), PPOS peristome position (type), SB subclaustralis bending (type), SH shell height, SMW shell maximum width, W number of whorls.
I thank you very much in advance for you help which is - believe -  most appreciated.
I hope to hear fromyou soon and do not hesitate to get in touch with me if needed.
My kindest regards,
Willy
