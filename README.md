### Montenegrina NJ Tree based on qualitative/quantitative morphometrics

#### 1) Qualitative Data

Here, we constructed a distance matrix based on hamming distances across all 12 qualitative characters using the _cultevo_ package in _R_. After that, we used the Neighbor-Joining Method as implemented in the package _phangorn_ to reconstruct a tree and applied midpoint rooting using the package _phytools_. Using the _boot.phylo_ function in the _ape_ package, we performed 100 times bootstrapping prior to plotting the final tree with _ggtree_.

#### 2) Quantitative Data
Likewise, we repeated the same analyses as above for the 24 quantitative datasets using Euclidean distances as implemented in the standard _dist_ function in _R_.

#### 3) Maximum Parsiomny of Qualitative Data
Finally, we plotted the Maximum Parsimony Tree generated by Gerhard Steiner using the same color code, shapes and naming scheme as above


The raw input data can be found [here](data/Montenegrina_rawdata.xlsx) and the _R_ code for the analysis in [here](analyses/analyses.R) and for the comparison of genetic, morphometric and geographic distances in [here]().
